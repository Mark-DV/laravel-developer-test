# Laravel Developer Test - Home Task README

This project leverages Laravel for backend functionality and employs PHPUnit for testing, while integrating Vue3 and TailwindCSS for frontend design. The main features include:

### Basic Authentication and User Roles
The project offers basic Laravel authentication with a Vue-based administrator login. This enables users to log in as administrators.

### Database Setup and Seeding
The application employs database migrations to create the necessary schemas for two main entities: Companies and Employees. The Companies table comprises fields such as Name (required), email, and logo (minimum 100Ã—100), and website. Meanwhile, the Employees table includes fields like First name (required), last name (required), Company (linked through a foreign key to Companies), email, and phone. The initial setup involves the creation of a seeder using the command `php artisan make:seeder DatabaseSeeder`, followed by populating the database with sample data through `php artisan db:seed --class=DatabaseSeeder`.

### File Storage
Logos for the companies are stored in the `storage/app/public` directory, which is made accessible from the public domain. This is facilitated by establishing a storage link with the command `php artisan storage:link`.

### Resource Controllers and CRUD Operations
The project employs Laravel's resource controllers to manage CRUD (Create / Read / Update / Delete) operations for both Companies and Employees. The controllers come with default methods: index, create, store, edit, update, and destroy. Laravel's validation functions are used in conjunction with Request classes to ensure data integrity.

### Pagination
Laravel's built-in pagination is utilized to display lists of Companies and Employees, with each page showing up to 10 entries.

### Custom Authentication
Authentication mechanisms are developed without relying on Laravel Fortify, enhancing the project's uniqueness.

### Email Notifications
The application incorporates email notifications, which are triggered when new company entries are added. For email testing, Mailtrap is employed with the sender set as `markdv39@gmail.com` and the receiver as the current user's email.

### Testing
PHPUnit is used for testing purposes, with the project configured to work with Mailtrap for email-related tests.

### Instructions for Running:
1. Execute the following commands:
2. Create a seeder using: `php artisan make:seeder DatabaseSeeder`
3. Seed the database using: `php artisan db:seed --class=DatabaseSeeder`
4. Establish a storage link with: `php artisan storage:link`
5. Launch the project by executing `php artisan serve`.
